  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we direct our attention to two recreational mathematics problems, the internal and external grazing goat problem. The former was solved recently in terms of a ratio of contour integrals, and we will derive a new closed-form solution to the latter. It turns out that a problem that is able to be stated in such simple terms will have an incredibly complex solution to the latter.",
