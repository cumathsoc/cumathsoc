  "title": "The Product Structure of Planar Graphs",
  "presentor": "Pat Morin",
  "date": "October 31 2023",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 3422",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Planar graphs have been the subject of intense study for over 300 years. This talk will present a recent structural result on planar graphs, which is now known as the Product Structure Theorem. It states that any planar graph G is contained in the product of two very simple graphs: a graph H that is tree-like and a path P. Since its appearance in 2020, the Product Structure Theorem has been used to resolve a number of longstanding open problems on planar graphs. This talk is aimed at a broad audience without any particular background in graph theory. It will include everything needed to understand the statement of the result, give a sketch of its proof, and describe some of its applications.",
