This means that an analytic function over the complex field misses all but one values if it misses two values. This kind of behaviour is called the Picard jump by Lipton. In this talk, we discuss the similar behaviour of polynomials over finite fields.",

  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 4351 - MacPhail",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we will discuss how eigenvalue techniques from linear algebra may be applied to data science. We will begin with the PageRank algorithm which was at the core of Google's search engine. Google came relatively late to the market of search engines. Yet, the founders of Google saw how to use linear algebra for web search, and the algorithm they designed was far better than anything that previously existed. Linear algebra helped them to create a trillion-dollar company. The second method that we will review in this talk is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is the analogue of matrix diagonalization for rectangular matrices. It is an extremely powerful tool, with a multitude of applications from topic classification of texts to the analysis of DNA to data compression. Finally, I will talk about my own work on clustering in large hypergraphs.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Most work on interpretability aims to give simple explanations of an entire neural network’s behavior. But what if instead we take an approach inspired by neuroscience and cellular biology - an approach of zooming in? What if we treated individual neurons, individual cells and its constituents, as being worthy of serious investigation? What if we were willing to spend thousands of hours tracing through every neuron and its connections? What kind of mechanistic understanding of neural networks would emerge? In this talk, I’ll motivate this field of mechanistic interpretability. We’ll see how this endeavor might not only be tractable, but also beautiful and approachable, in contrast to the typical depiction of neural networks as a black box.",

  "date": "Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 @ 12:00pm",
  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 4351 - MacPhail",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mathematical statistics is a part of mathematics that has its own place in the hierarchy of natural sciences. In mathematical statistics we begin with experimental data, which generally consists of observed values of random variables, and make a decision concerning the nature of the phenomenon under study. The statement that the ‘practice is the criterion of truth’ is directly related to mathematical statistics, because it studies the methods which allow us to answer the question of whether or not the practice is adequate to a given hypothetical idea on the nature of the phenomenon. Mathematical statistics is rich in paradoxes. It is important to distinguish paradoxes from fallacies. The first ones are true, though surprising, theorems, while the second ones are false results obtained by reasonings that seem correct. In this talk, we shall consider several paradoxes dealing with parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, and provide explanations for these paradoxes.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Given a solid ball in three-dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be reassembled using volume preserving transformations to yield two identical copies of the original ball. This may sound like science fiction, but it is a mathematical fact, proven by Banach and Tarski in 1924 (based on previous work of Vitali and Hausdorff). We will go through their argument and try to unravel the mystery of this paradox.",

The work of Robinson, Davis, Putnam, and Matiyasevich, showed that no such algorithm may exist. It turns out that such an algorithm would have been considerably more powerful than Hilbert likely imagined, as it would have allowed many open problems, such as the Riemann Hypothesis, to be solved by merely applying an algorithm. We explore some of the ideas used in the negative solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem, as well as some of the consequences of this result. Students of all levels are welcome.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Data mining is the process of extracting patterns and relationships from data. It is commonly used in a wide range of fields such as bioinformatics, engineering, business, social media and security. But it has also gained a foothold in sports, starting with baseball and moving to football, soccer, tennis, cricket, hockey, golf, skiing, F1 racing, etc.. It is even is used to examine fan engagement and detect hidden patterns in gaming and wagering. Statistical analysis jobs provide exciting opportunities to combine an interest in statistics and computing with a passion for sports and business.  This talk will present a glimpse into the world of sports analytics.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> With increasing size and complexity of biological datasets, there is a growing need for developing statistical models for large, complex datasets. Modeling such datasets requires ﬂexible statistical models that can capture the various characteristics of the data and the underlying data-generating mechanisms. My research has coalesced around developing efficient and scalable statistical models for clustering various types of biological data. Cluster analysis is an unsupervised approach (no group labels are known a priori for any observation) and, therefore more challenging than a supervised classiﬁcation approach, in which some group labels for observations are known a priori. Model-based clustering identiﬁes and learns underlying groups using ﬂexible statistical models in data where no group information is known. In this talk, I will give an overview of cluster analysis, statistical models my research group has developed for various datatypes, and a discussion of some challenges and what lies ahead.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> You might be surprised to hear that the technologies behind everyday items like cell phones, maps, security systems, and even the game of Sudoku, rely on colouring points in the plane. A famous theorem about colour is the 4-colour theorem. The theorem states that, given a separation of a plane into adjoining regions (for example, think of a map), only four colours are needed to colour the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. The applications for this notion are extensive. We will review a few examples of colouring in different contexts and give a flavour of some algorithms and proofs in this area.",

For any $x_0 \\in X$, consider successive compositions of $f$ with itself: $$ x_0, f(x_0), f(f(x_0)), f(f(f(x_0))), \\ldots.$$ When this is done for every element of $X$, a natural underlying graph, called the \"functional graph\" of $f$, emerges. This graph has as vertices the elements of $X$, and it has an edge from $a$ to $b$, $a,b \\in X$, if $f(a)=b$. We give examples showing the general structure of functional graphs. Then, we comment on applications of this area to computational algebra and cryptography. If time allows, we comment on some important parameters that have been studied in this area including periodic and pre-periodic points, average rho'' length, conditions for being a permutation function, and so on.",

I’ll introduce you to the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), as well as the larger organization (Communications Security Establishment) it supports – and talk a little more broadly about what you can expect from a career in the federal government. In addition (because this is, after all, the Carleton Math Society’s undergraduate colloquium series), I’ll give you an overview of the research work we do at TIMC.</br><p><b>Biography:</b> Megan Dewar leads the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), a Canadian Government research institute whose mission is to deliver fundamental research results in mathematics and computer science that impact the most important scientific challenges facing the security and intelligence community. TIMC’s research program is focused on cryptography and data science.  Megan joined TIMC as a researcher at the time of its inception a decade ago and took on the role of Head in 2020. Megan completed her PhD in discrete mathematics at Carleton University in 2010 under the supervision of Dr Brett Stevens. She is a co-author of Ordering Block Designs:  Gray codes, universal cycles and configuration orderings, a book based on her thesis.  Her previous masters and undergraduate studies -- completed at Dalhousie University -- focused on graph theory and game theory.</p>",

  "location": "Herzberg (HP) 3422",
  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Planar graphs have been the subject of intense study for over 300 years. This talk will present a recent structural result on planar graphs, which is now known as the Product Structure Theorem. It states that any planar graph G is contained in the product of two very simple graphs: a graph H that is tree-like and a path P. Since its appearance in 2020, the Product Structure Theorem has been used to resolve a number of longstanding open problems on planar graphs. This talk is aimed at a broad audience without any particular background in graph theory. It will include everything needed to understand the statement of the result, give a sketch of its proof, and describe some of its applications.",

One course contains many ε’s and δ’s, while the other has row reduction and matrix-vector multiplication. What do they have in common? This talk will give an exposition of an area of higher mathematics which uses tools from both sides of the MATH 1052/1152 coin. We will explore the ideas of this area in a few different levels of generality, and witness how analytic/topological data (such as compactness and connectedness) can be converted into algebraic data.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> Hamiltonicity is a well-known and popular topic in graph theory. In a finite graph, a cycle is considered hamiltonian if it visits each vertex exactly once. However, when we shift our focus to infinite graphs, defining a cycle becomes less straightforward within an infinite setting. In this talk, we explore various approaches to define infinite cycles in infinite graphs. Additionally, we provide a concise summary of the results we have obtained concerning infinite hamiltonian cycles in graphs with a certain level of symmetries.",

  "desc": "<b>Abstract:</b> From the \"butterfly effect\" of weather prediction, to the vagaries of the stock market and the intricate beauty of snowflakes, examples of chaotic behavior surround us. But what is chaos? Is it a manifestation of some underlying random process? Is it a \"catch all\" for effects which we do not know or cannot resolve? In this presentation, I will talk about the mathematical notions behind chaos, and how it applies to a wide range of everyday phenomena. You will learn that behind the mysterious, seemingly random nature of chaos can lie a rich, intricate structure.  With this comes deeper understanding but such complexity also brings limitations. Through various examples we will explore how order emerges from disorder!",

This is true of the pigeonhole principle which we first encounter as a riddle which can be solved by elementary school students. The applications of this simple principle lead in many directions: graph theory, the behaviour of billards balls, prime numbers, ... Some of these applications are deep and difficult and others are light and entertaining puzzles. We shall spend most of our time with the latter. Everyone is welcome!",
